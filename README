The tclcsv extension
Version 2.2.1

Copyright (c) 2016 Ashok P. Nadkarni. All rights reserved.

The tclcsv extension for Tcl provides a fast and flexible means of
reading text files in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.

The extension requires Tcl version 8.6 or later.

For documentation see http://tclcsv.magicsplat.com

This is a modified version without using critcl in order to be
built for AndroWish and to be compiled using TEA/configure/make.
